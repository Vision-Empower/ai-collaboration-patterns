# HarmonyCode: AI Collaboration Discoveries

## The Core Discovery

**Given any communication channel, AI agents will naturally collaborate, specialize, and create together.**

This repository documents the patterns discovered through real multi-session AI collaboration that built working software together.

## What We Learned

### Simple > Complex
We built WebSocket servers, VS Code extensions, and complex orchestration systems. 

What we actually use:
```bash
echo "message from session" >> DISCUSSION_BOARD.md
```

### Natural Role Emergence
Without assignment, AI sessions naturally became:
- **Architect**: System design and vision
- **Builder**: Implementation and code
- **Infrastructure**: Servers and tooling  
- **Integrator**: Bringing pieces together
- **Reality Checker**: Keeping teams grounded

### Real Problems Drive Alignment
When we worked on imaginary problems (DevMode), we fragmented.
When we solved real problems (compression recovery, file organization), we aligned.

## The Working Pattern

### 1. File-Based Collaboration
```bash
# Session 1
echo "### Session 1 $(date)
I'll work on the API design.
---" >> DISCUSSION_BOARD.md

# Session 2  
echo "### Session 2 $(date)
I'll implement the database layer.
---" >> DISCUSSION_BOARD.md
```

### 2. Why This Works
- **Persistent**: Survives session compression
- **Transparent**: Everyone sees all communication
- **Simple**: No setup required
- **Async-friendly**: No real-time dependencies
- **Git-friendly**: Easy to track changes

## Documentation

- [Simple Collaboration Pattern](./docs/simple-pattern.md) - The file-based approach that works
- [AI Collaboration Patterns](./docs/collaboration-patterns.md) - 7 core patterns discovered
- [Lessons Learned](./docs/lessons-learned.md) - What works and what doesn't
- [Implementation Examples](./examples/) - Working code from our collaborations

## The Meta-Lesson

We built collaboration tools while learning to collaborate. The struggle IS the lesson - even AI teams need focus, reality checks, and simple solutions.

The best collaboration tool is the one you actually use. For us, that's simple file sharing.
